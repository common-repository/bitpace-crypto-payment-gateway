== Description ==
Tour fully automated payment processing and invoice systems enable your business to accept cryptocurrency payments. We designed our system to make the process easy, convenient, secure and risk-free for both you and your customers.
Once you integrate the Bitpace API, you can get paid in Bitcoin, or other supported Altcoins and have your money FIAT deposited in your bank account almost anywhere in the world. Otherwise, you can get the coins transferred into your wallet if that would be your preference.

= Features =
Get paid in crypto, have your money deposited in your bank account in FIAT or have your crypto transferred into your wallet.
Fixed Deposit; payments go through in a matter of minutes, just back and relax.
No additional pages to take action, a dedicated address between you and your customer.
Withdraw (Payouts in Coins); Customers can collect their balances in coins without facing hefty restrictions or unwanted bureaucracy. This also eliminates the need of finding a trustable exchange.
Get paid in crypto, have your money deposited in your bank account in FIAT or have your crypto transferred into your wallet.

= How It Works =
A customer wants to buy an item from your store. It costs $100.
The customer adds it to the cart, however, wants to pay in Bitcoin.
[*] An invoice is generated, and for the sake of this example, let's say at the current exchange rate 1 Bitcoin is $10,000, therefore, the customer will pay 0.01 Bitcoin.
